- `side`: `buy` or `sell`

## Market Discovery Workflows

### Workflow A: Find Markets on a Topic

1. **Search for markets by keyword:**
```json
{
  "tool": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?active=true&limit=10&tag=politics",
  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

Common tags: `politics`, `crypto`, `sports`, `finance`, `science`, `entertainment`, `world`

2. **Parse the response** to extract:
   - `id`: Event ID
   - `slug`: URL-friendly identifier
   - `title`: Human-readable title
   - `markets`: Array of associated markets with their token IDs

3. **Get prices** for interesting markets using the CLOB API.

### Workflow B: Monitor a Specific Market

1. **Find the market** by slug or search
2. **Extract the token_id** from the market data
3. **Get current price:**
```json
{
  "tool": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://clob.polymarket.com/price?token_id=<TOKEN_ID>&side=buy",
  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

4. **Get orderbook depth:**
```json
{
  "tool": "web_fetch",
  "url": "https://clob.polymarket.com/book?token_id=<TOKEN_ID>",
  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

## Understanding Market Data

### Event Structure
```json
{
  "id": "event-uuid",
  "slug": "event-name-slug",
  "title": "Will X happen?",
  "description": "Full description...",
  "active": true,
  "closed": false,
  "markets": [
    {
      "id": "market-uuid",
      "question": "Yes outcome",
      "conditionId": "0x...",  // Use this as token_id for CLOB
      "outcomes": ["Yes", "No"],
      "outcomePrices": ["0.65", "0.35"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Price Interpretation
- Prices are between 0 and 1 (representing probability/percentage)
- Price of 0.65 = 65% implied probability
- Binary markets have YES/NO outcomes where YES + NO prices should sum to ~1

### Orderbook Structure
```json
{
  "bids": [{"price": "0.64", "size": "1000"}, ...],
  "asks": [{"price": "0.66", "size": "500"}, ...]
}
```

## Filtering & Pagination

|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `active` | Filter by active status | `active=true` |
| `closed` | Filter by closed status | `closed=false` |
| `limit` | Max results to return | `limit=20` |
| `offset` | Skip N results | `offset=10` |
| `tag` | Filter by category tag | `tag=politics` |

  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

  "extract_mode": "raw"
}
```

## Important Notes

1. **Token IDs**: The `conditionId` from market data is used as `token_id` in CLOB API calls
2. **Rate Limits**: Be mindful of API rate limits; cache responses when possible
3. **Price Updates**: Prices change frequently; always fetch fresh data for trading decisions
4. **Binary Markets**: Most markets are binary (YES/NO) - the YES and NO token prices should sum to approximately 1.00
5. **Resolution**: Markets resolve based on real-world outcomes; check the `resolution_source` field for details

---

## Error Handling

If an API call fails:
1. Check the URL format and parameters
2. Verify the market/event exists and is active
3. Try with a different token_id if the market has multiple outcome tokens
4. Check if the market has been resolved (closed markets may have limited data)

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad request (check parameters)
- `404`: Market/event not found
- `429`: Rate limited (wait and retry)
- `500`: Server error (retry later)
